# Data Structures and Algorithms - Spicy problems
This is a collection of various data structures related problems and **strategies** implemented in C++ (Maybe Python too) that we, *as students*, considered important to practice 
and extend your knowledge on these topics. 

## Motivation
We considered that we could join various problems with different problems in order to study these topics in an organized way. 
The state of most tech companies with these problem solving strategies is **important**, since most of those companies will take in account our ability and knowledge 
on these topics. As a matter of fact, a lot of students in *STEM* (and even not STEM) related careers will consider getting an *internship* at these companies.
The motive is very simple: to learn how to solve problems in an efficient manner. 

## Project's presentation

We'll structure this project in topics that are strategies (widely used) to solve this problems with ease.

### Data structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
  - Single Linked List
  - Double Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues
  - Priority Queues
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees 
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Segments
- Suffix Arrays, Trees

### Algorithms
- Searching and sorting
- Pattern searching
- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Divide & Conquer
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Geometrical Algorithms


**Each problem will contain variated solutions and explanations (*using comments*) that will help enthusiasts to understand how to create strategies to solve this type of problems**
